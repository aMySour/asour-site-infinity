        <h1>Why does this exist?</h1>
        <p>Infinity is meant to make websites feel less like a collection of pages and more like a place you visit and
            explore.</p>
        <p>It also allows for much more dynamic and interconnected content. You could have a natural flow from page to
            page by putting relevant ones close together. Or you could have a page that's only accessible by going
            through a secret passage in another page.</p>
        <p>Overall, Infinity isn't meant to replace traditional websites, but rather to be a new fun and unique kind of
            site.</p>
